#AI/ML Beginner Journey
## Project 1: Spam Message Classifier (In Progress)

This repository is part of my structured AI/ML learning journey as a beginner in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To build a Spam Message Classifier from scratch while learning the fundamentals of:

- Python for ML
- Data preprocessing
- Text cleaning
- Feature extraction
- Basic ML workflow

---

## 📅 Progress So Far

### ✅ Day 1 – Project Setup
- Installed Python libraries
- Set up development environment
- Understood the ML workflow
- Loaded dataset

### ✅ Day 2 – Data Understanding
- Explored dataset
- Checked class distribution
- Understood spam vs ham messages
- Basic data visualization

### ✅ Day 3 – Text Preprocessing
- Lowercasing text
- Removing punctuation
- Removing stopwords
- Basic text cleaning pipeline

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (planned)
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## 🎯 Current Status

Project paused at preprocessing stage due to academic workload.  
Will continue model building and evaluation in the future.

---

## 📌 Future Plan

- Convert text to numerical features (TF-IDF / Bag of Words)
- Train ML model (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)
- Evaluate model performance
- Improve accuracy
- Deploy simple web app (optional)

## 💡 Why This Project?

As an aspiring AI/ML engineer, I believe in building fundamentals step by step rather than jumping directly into advanced models.

This project represents the beginning of that disciplined journey.
